			    I18N::LangTags

I18N::LangTags - functions for dealing with RFC1766-style language
tags

Language tags are a formalism, described in RFC 1766, for declaring
what language form (language and possibly dialect) a given chunk of
information is in.

This library provides functions for common tasks involving language
tags as they are needed in a variety of protocols and applications.

The functions it currently provides are:
	is_language_tag($lang1)
	extract_language_tags($whatever)
	same_language_tag($lang1, $lang2)
	similarity_language_tag($lang1, $lang2)
	is_dialect_of($lang1, $lang2)

See the POD for more information.
